# NDN Security

Security is baked into the core of NDN, and is a fundamental part of the architecture. NDN networks and applications utilizes a data-centric name-based security and trust model, where all data is signed by the producer of the data.

Each subsection below describes one aspect of the NDN security model.

- [Trust Model](./trust-model.md) - How does NDN define data trustworthiness?
- [Signatures](./signatures.md) - How is the trust model implemented with digital signatures?
